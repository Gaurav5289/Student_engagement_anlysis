## 🌟 Key Features

### 🔍 Data Cleaning & Processing (Python)

- Removed duplicates and handled missing values in demographic and feedback data.
- Standardized engagement metrics (time spent, completion rate, etc.).
- Created calculated fields like average engagement and dropout indicators.

### 📊 Insights Generated

- Highest engagement found in **Delhi (103.3 mins)** and **Kolkata (104.4 mins)**.
- Age group **18–25** is the most active and promising for targeted campaigns.
- Course **PY202** has high enrollment but a low **completion rate (56.1%)**.
- Very weak correlation (**-0.05**) between course ratings and actual completions.
- **Mumbai** and **Kolkata** show lowest enrollments — potential areas for outreach.

### 📆 Strategic Recommendations

- Redesign low-performing courses with gamification and smart reminders.
- Engage the 18–25 segment with personalized nudges and goal tracking.
